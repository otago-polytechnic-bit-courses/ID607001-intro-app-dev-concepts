# Project and Practical

## REST APIs URL (Render Web Service)
You can access the deployed REST APIs on Render using the following URL:
- [Your choice REST API](<REPLACE WITH A LINK TO YOUR REST API>)
- [OpenTDB REST API](<REPLACE WITH A LINK TO YOUR REST API>)

## Setup Environment

Follow these steps to set up the project after cloning the repository:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <REPLACE WITH A LINK TO YOUR GITHUB REPO.git>
cd <REPLACE WITH YOUR GITHUB REPO NAME>
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file and filling in the required configurations:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=

ADD OTHER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
```

## Running REST APIs Locally

To run the REST APIs on your local machine, run the following command:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```

Your local API should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>.

## Database Migration

To create and apply a new migration using **Prisma**, run the following command:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```

## Reset PostgreSQL Database

To reset the **PostgreSQL** database, run the following command:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```

## Seeding Admin and Basic Users

To seed the database with `ADMIN` and `BASIC` users, run the following command:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```

This will insert predefined users with admin and basic roles into the database.

## Seeding the Database with Prisma

To seed your database with additional data using **Prisma**, follow these steps:

1. Write your seed script inside `prisma/seed.js`.

2. Run the following command to execute the seeding script:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```

The seeding script will populate your database with the necessary data.

## Running API Tests

Ensure that your development server is running (or use a test database).

To run the **API tests** locally, run the following command:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```

This will execute all the **API tests** to ensure the endpoints are working as expected.

## Opening Prisma Studio

To visually inspect your database using **Prisma Studio**, run the following command:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```

## Code Quality Checks

To check your code for any issues, run the following command:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```

## Code Formatting

To format your code according to project guidelines, run the following command:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```
