# 12: React 3

If you get stuck, a completed version of this project is available in the **exemplar** directory.

## Formative Assessment

Before you start, create a new branch called **12-formative-assessment**.

If you get stuck on any of the following tasks, feel free to use **ChatGPT** permitting, you are aware of the following:

- If you provide **ChatGPT** with a prompt that is not refined enough, it may generate a not-so-useful response
- Do not trust **ChatGPT's** responses blindly. You must still use your judgement and may need to do additional research to determine if the response is correct
- Acknowledge that you are using **ChatGPT**. In the **README.md** file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to **ChatGPT** and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work
